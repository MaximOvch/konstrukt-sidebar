                <h2>Introduction <sup>Chapter 1</sup></h2>
                <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup.
                    instructions, they've moved to <u>their own section</u>. Continue reading for an introduction to the
                    documentation, Native Components, React, and more!</p>

                <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the
                    app platform’s native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform’s APIs as
                    well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <em class="italic">
                        bundles of reusable, nestable code </em>. You can learn more about React in the next section. But
                    first, let’s cover how components work in
                    React Native.</p>

            <section class="react_fundamentals" id="section3">
                <h2>react fundamentals <sup>Chapter 3</sup></h2>
                <p>React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
                    JavaScript.
                    To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started
                    or
                    can serve as a refresher course.</p>
                <p>We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                        <strong> components.</strong> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples:
                        friendly
                        approachable
                        creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong> JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside
                        JavaScript like
                        so:
                        <code>&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</code>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p> The React docs have a <u>comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is
                    JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name, and
                    embedding
                    it with curly braces inside <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code>
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                        <strong> props.</strong> Props is short for &ldquo;properties&rdquo;.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong> state.</strong> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how
                        components render, state
                        is
                        like a component’s personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time
                        or
                        that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <section class="handline_text_input" id="section4">
                <h2>handling text input <sup>Chapter 4</sup></h2>
                <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <em>onChangeText</em> prop
                    that takes
                    a
                    function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to
                    be
                    called when the text is submitted. </p>
                <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language.
                    In
                    this
                    new language, every single word is written the same way: 🍕. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be
                    translated as &ldquo;🍕 🍕&rdquo;.</p>
